Node.js has to be installed.

1. Rename your .json file into json.json, then put it in folder called "put your .json file here". (thereis one 
   already for the test)
2. Run your terminal (cmd , Node.js cmd, Visual Studio Code terminal...) in folder by pressing Shift + right click 
   and select "Open command windows here" ("Open PowerShell window here" if installed) or just open cmd and go to 
   "json2xml Converter" folder.
3. Run json.js by typing in "node json.js".
4. Your .json file is now converted in .xml, called "yourXmlFile.xml", located in main folder (json2xmlConverter).
